Search in layers
================

You can search for features in vector layers.
The search is currently performing the same as the *all layers locator filter* in QGIS
(accessible in QGIS locator bar using *af* prefix).

Configure search in QGIS
------------------------

1. Choose the layers which are searchable in :menuselection:`Project --> Project Properties --> Identify Layers`
2. Define the *display expression* for the concerned layers, this will be used for searching for features. This is configured under :menuselection:`Vector Layer Properties --> Display` page
