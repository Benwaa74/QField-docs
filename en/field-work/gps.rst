GPS
===

A short press on the GPS button will turn on the GPS and center to the current location once positioning information is available.

A long press on the GPS button will show the positioning menu.

Inside the positioning menu you can turn on the positioning display which will show the current coordinates which are reprojected into the project CRS along with precision information.

.. note::
    If you see WGS 84 lat/lon information instead of information in your project CRS, you probably have no signal yet.

Using external GNSS-Reciever
----------------------------

It is possible to provide a mock location via a separate android app to QField.
There are several options for this, one of them is `Android NTRIP Client

To use this you have to `enable mock locations on your Android device
